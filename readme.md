# Multi-Agent Legal Chatbot

## Overview
This project implements a multi-agent chatbot designed to assist users by fetching legal information from trusted sources, summarizing complex legal topics, and providing clear, concise answers. The system utilizes two agents:

- **Query Agent**: Retrieves relevant sections from legal documents based on user queries.
- **Summarization Agent**: Extracts key explanations and converts complex legal language into plain, understandable language.

The chatbot is built using Streamlit for the frontend, which interacts with backend agents that leverage advanced NLP models for legal information extraction and summarization.

## Features
- **Query Agent**: Fetches relevant sections from legal documents based on the user's question.
- **Summarization Agent**: Converts complex legal jargon into easy-to-understand explanations.
- **Streamlit Frontend**: User-friendly interface for interacting with the chatbot.
